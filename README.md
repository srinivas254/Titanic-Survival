### Titanic Survival Prediction

This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data, making it an excellent starting point for learning data analysis and machine learning techniques.

#### Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about individual passengers, including features such as:

- Passenger ID
- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass (Ticket class: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

#### Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions. Identify missing values, outliers, and potential patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering if necessary.
3. **Feature Selection:** Select relevant features that are likely to have predictive power.
4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
5. **Model Training:** Train the selected model(s) on the preprocessed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, analyze the ROC curve and AUC to assess the model's ability to discriminate between classes.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize performance.
8. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict survival outcomes for new data.
